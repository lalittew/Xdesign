Explaining highlights of project:

Framework and language used:
This project is made by using Selenium Cucumber Framework with Page Object Model using Java as language
This project is Maven project and all maven selenium,cucumber,java,junit and other dependencies can be found in "pom.xml" file
I build this project using Intellij IDE and using mac operating system


Feature File:
1) This path for feature files is : /Xdesign/Features
2) Feature files contains different scenarios
3) Scenarios which are given in taken home task pdf file are all under XdesignHomePage.feature file

Note: Since there were not clear instructions whether I am allowed to change the gherkin format given I have used same statements as mentioned in
pdf file

Note: For the valid login credentials I needed to register into website which i was not compeletely sure how I can do, hence I have not written
exclusive test for the same but can be easily written using the test "Verify that user is not able to login into Hudl on giving wrong email or password"
and replacing the last step with correct page expection and also by replacing invalid credentials with valid credential


Step Definitions:
1) The path for Step definitions package files is: /Xdesign/src/test/java/stepDefinitions
2) The step definitions for the respective feature files can be found under this package
3) Under the steps definition file which part is doing what is briefly explained using comments

Locators and Functions:
1) This project contains 2 function files which can be found under package path: /Xdesign/src/test/java/functionFile
2) All the different pages contains different functions files
3) The locators find to use the element can be found under respective related function file name
4) Different type of locators have been used to explain variety and best way to find the elements on page
5) Functions files also contains Strings related to respective page at top level and then all locators below to it
6) All the common functions which can be used across any pages are defined in GeneralFunctions class


How to run the tests:
1) There are two ways tests can be run:
        a) Go to TestRunner.java class and run TestRunner function by clicking green button next to it
        b) Create a Run configuration. This can be done by adding a Junit configuration using + button under edit configuration
        and selecting TestRunner class

Note:
TestRunner class can be found under path: /Xdesign/src/main/java/testRunner/TestRunner.java
1) Make sure all the test having annotation same as defined in Test Runner class, for this project
2) I have used "@test" as an annotation
3) If the annotations above the test are not matching the one defined in TestRunner class it will skip those tests


ScreenShot for failing test:
1) Tests which are failed will generate screen shots and that can be found under path with the respective test name and step: /HudlLoginProject/ScreenShots


HTML Reports
1) HTML report will get generated at the end of run and can be found at path: /HudlLoginProject/target/cucumber-reports/index.html
2) Just drag and drop this "index.html" report in browser to view report

General Notes:
1) Since for the Scenario 3 there was little ambiguity I have used serial number as reference to find out if the list is sorted in descending order or not
Ideally this is the first question I will be asking with Product, that what is expected result should be so I can write test based on the answer.
2) There are some extra Scenarios I have added to test because I was not sure what expectations are set from me.
3) I have not changed any statements from the take home task for the steps because I was not sure if I am supposed to do or not
So I have tried automated the steps in best possible way to accomodate testing, but if I was sure then can make the scenario steps more clear
for better understanding
4) Lot of steps could have been re=used but again I was not sure if I am, allowed to modify the scenario steps, hence there might be some amount of
repeatability can be seen in steps
